## About Me

I’m a second-year Information Systems student at the University of Canterbury, minoring in Business Analytics. I’m passionate about how business and technology intersect to solve problems and support decision-making.

Currently, I’m developing skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and IT systems using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and SQL. I aim to grow into a role where I can apply my knowledge to real-world challenges and continuously expand my skillset.
